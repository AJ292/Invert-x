    <h1>Music of the Week: Magical Trick Society</h1>
    <h2>Published 31 March, 2013</h2>
    <p>It's not quite a film. It's not quite a game. Though it shares similarities with the aforementioned mediums, it really can't be classified as either one of them. What it can be classified as isn't strictly relevant either, as the sum of its parts have given birth to something rather exciting, particularly to those that value story.</p>
    <p>If one were to pick hairs, Dear Esther strays closer to film than game; viewed as a gaming experience, it would fair quite poorly. While it's important for appropriate games to include a rich and well-written story, the fact that Dear Esther features essentially no gameplay discredits a pure labelling of 'game'. Gameplay is, after all, the whole point of gaming; in a rather blunt sense, Pong has more gameplay than Dear Esther.</p>
