                </div>                 
                <p><i>The Terminator</i> was one of those meteoric, Hollywood fairy tales that seem wonderfully far-fetched under the current, studio-mandated production model. Here was James Cameron, a young Canadian special effects artist (self taught, no less) with two films under his directorial belt: <i>Xenogenesis</i>, a science-fiction short with obvious thematic and aesthetic roots in Star Wars; and <i>Piranha II: The Spawning</i>, a shlock budget horror film, borne from the B movie genesis tank of Roger Corman. Neither release was particularly notable, aside from demonstrating Cameron’s tenacity and willingness to learn and create.</p>

				<p>From those humble origins sprang a film about a malicious, time-travelling cyborg assassin, that, on paper, seemed every bit as ridiculous as the progenitors that paraded luridly from Corman’s eclectic banner. A box office return of $78 million from a meagre budget of $6.4 million for Cameron’s stark, noir-ish visual and psychological onslaught established his well-earned reputation as an auteur. It was further cemented in <i>Aliens</i> and <i>The Abyss</i>, but it wasn’t until 1991’s <i>Terminator 2: Judgement Day</i> that Cameron truly brandished his abilities as a director.</p>

				<p>Dear Esther allows me to essentially create my own pacing for the story. If I choose to, I can let the poetry of the script sink in and be afforded more context by stopping progression and watching the waves rush to the shore. Yes, the story ultimately has a set path that it takes to the end, but that journey is not an A to B of frames being spit out of a projecter: if something that I'm seeing on screen resonants as a result of the script, I can stop and reflect on it without jarring the experience, or leaving the world.</p>
				<p class="pull-quote">In essence, it leverages the advantage that games have over films (that of player interactivity), creating something that is both mediums and neither of them at the same time.</p>
				<p>This is an incredibly powerful tool. In essence, it leverages the advantage that games have over films (that of player interactivity), creating something that is both mediums and neither of them at the same time. However, there are potential flaws to this, mostly in the form of the inherent lack of pacing. Watch any decent film and you'll notice that the composition of the scene (the framing, the cuts, the score) is carefully orchestrated to propel the story forward, as well as provide some form of emotional resonance. An experience like Dear Esther, by its nature, cannot offer this same experience: if a player chooses to walk right when the story would've benefitted from walking left, an inherent pacing problem is presented. If a player decides to stop short, further story sequences will not be triggered until they choose to start again. There are ways of circumventing this (and not all stories require the benefit of controlled pacing, as evidenced by Dear Esther), making the future of this medium rather interesting.</p>
				<p>The real issue, however, is authors flocking to this medium simply to ham fist their story into it. Every story benefits from choosing the appropriate medium to tell it in: be it film, novel, game or anything in between. Choosing this particular medium out of convenience, or out of the desire to embrace it as a gimmick will surely condemn it to irrelevancy. This would be a travesty to something that I would certainly like to see more of.</p>
